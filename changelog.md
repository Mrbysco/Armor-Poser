## The UI update (Backported to 1.20.1)
* The Armor Poser GUI has undergone an update.
* The semi-transparent gray background has been removed. UI text is now white with a drop shadow, ensuring visibility on white surfaces.
* Added rotated text saying "Click and scroll" next to position/rotation fields. This hints at the ability to scroll and adjust values when number fields are focused.

### Poses Overhaul
* The Poses screen has been overhauled to make it easier for new poses to be added and user poses can now be added!<br>
* The main Armor Poser screen now has a Save button next to the copy and paste button, clicking it will open a screen that allows you to name the pose and save it to the User Poses.<br>
* If you added a pose and want to remove it, you can now do so by clicking the pose and clicking the delete button. (This only works on user added poses)

### New Features
* 3 new buttons have been added to the main Armor Poser gui, pressing them does the following:
    * Block - Align held block, so it appears on the surface
    * Item: Aligns the held item, with the option to hold Shift for upright alignment.
    * Tool - Align held tool, so it appears flat on the surface
* Add a button that shows a list of nearby armor stands, allowing you select armor stands that are inside walls / hidden
